## :wrench: Usage

Include the following dependency to your project:

```xml 
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.drjekyll</groupId>
  <artifactId>colorpicker</artifactId>
  <version>1.4.3</version>
</dependency>
```

Use the class `com.bric.colorpicker.ColorPicker` as an entry point. You can easily initialize the panel using

```java
ColorPicker colorPicker = new ColorPicker(true, true);
colorPicker.addColorListener(colorModel -> System.out.println(colorModel.getColor()));
```

This creates a color picker component with expert controls and opacity settings. If the user selects a color, the color listener will be notified.

### :globe_with_meridians: Localization

The color picker supports localization. You can set the locale by passing it to the constructor:

```java
ColorPicker colorPicker = new ColorPicker(true, true, Locale.FRENCH);
// or
ColorPickerDialog.showDialog(null, Color.GREEN, Locale.FRENCH);
```

Currently, the following languages are supported:
- English
- Español
- Français
- Deutsch
- Português
- Русский
